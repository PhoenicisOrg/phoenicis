In addition to running the `jar` file directly, you can also install POL 5 on your operating system.

## Ubuntu 16.04
To install POL 5 on Ubuntu, you need to execute the `deb` file inside the `target/packages` folder of the `phoenicis-dist` project (see [Build]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/Users/build.md %}) for more information).

If you already have POL 5 installed through a `deb` file, you can simply override your old installation by executing a newer `deb` POL 5 installation file. This will replace the old installation with a newer one.
