# What is Phoenicis PlayOnLinux?

Phoenicis PlayOnLinux is a piece of software which allows you to easily install and use numerous games and apps designed to run with Microsoft® Windows®.

Few games are compatible with GNU/Linux at the moment and it certainly is a factor preventing the migration to this system. Phoenicis PlayOnLinux brings a cost-free, accessible and efficient solution to this problem.

# What are Phoenicis PlayOnLinux’s features?

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the interesting points to know:
* You don’t have to own a Microsoft Windows license to use PlayOnLinux.
* Phoenicis PlayOnLinux is based on [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), and so profits from all its features yet it keeps the user from having to deal with its complexity.
* Phoenicis PlayOnLinux is [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).
* Phoenicis PlayOnLinux uses Java.

Nevertheless, Phoenicis PlayOnLinux has some bugs, as every piece of software:
* Occasional performance decrease (image may be less fluid and graphics less detailed).
* Not all games are supported. Nevertheless, you can use our manual installation module.
